    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Announcing a Better, Faster and Smoother Support Process</em></p>

<p>As part of our continuous effort to give you a better experience, we have just migrated our customer support processes to Freshdesk.  This change will allow us to focus our effort on making RubyWireless better, and letting the folks at FreshDesk make our Help &amp; Support system better.</p>

<p><a href="http://artificialgravity.freshdesk.com" target="_blank"><img class="left" src="http://artificialgravity.github.io/images/screenshots/freshdesk.png" width="400" title="Screenshot of Support Site" ></a></p>

<p>How does this make a difference to you?</p>

<p>Not a lot changes in terms of how you get in touch with us. You can shoot us an email to <a href="mailto:support@artificialgravity.co">support@artificialgravity.co</a>, and our support system will automatically create a ticket on your behalf. You will also be notified of our responses and status changes to your tickets via email as well, and you can send out your replies directly.</p>

<p>The first time you send us a support email, you will receive an email with activation instructions to login to our support site at artificialgravity.freshdesk.com. Going forward, you can check the status or add comments to your support queries here.  For convenience, the help menu in RubyWireless now has a link to the new support site and a direct link to your support tickets.</p>

<p>All open tickets in our old support system have been migrated to FreshDesk.  If you had an open ticket in the old system, you&rsquo;ll receive an email with activations instructions automatically.</p>

<p><a href="http://rubywireless.com" target="_blank"><img class="right" src="http://artificialgravity.github.io/images/screenshots/support_quicklink.png" width="400" title="Screenshot of Support Link" ></a>There&rsquo;s also a new Support &ldquo;Quick Link&rdquo; at the top of each page.  Clicking the link will allow you to send a support request without leaving the page you&rsquo;re on.  It also allows you to include a screenshot to help describe your issue.</p>

<p>We are actively populating our support portal with FAQs and solutions in our knowledge base, so you can help yourself to how-tos and instructions.</p>

<p>We love hearing from you
If you have any doubts or queries regarding our new support tools and policies, please drop us a line at support@artificialgravity.co, and weâ€™ll be glad to assist you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to the official blog of Artificial Gravity Inc, Software is our passion.</em></p>

<p>Hi, my name is <a href="http://randomutterings.com">Chris Barnes</a>, <img class="left card" src="https://s2.yimg.com/sk/3665/12653775913_20208f21e5_n.jpg" width="220" title="Photo of Chris Barnes" >
I&rsquo;m the company&rsquo;s founder and I&rsquo;ll be writing most of the articles here.  Our flagship product is RubyWireless, a Point of Sale system for US Cellular Agents.  The blog is a place for us to post updates, screencasts, and general news about the company.  Most articles will have a link to the <a href="https://plus.google.com/115713078281838461197/posts/RvTgpCML21b">Comments on Google+</a>.  Feedback is encouraged!  Let me introduce you to the rest of the team.</p>

<p><img class="right card" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5540/12650386174_55aaa86884_n.jpg" width="200" title="Photo of Angela" >
In addition to being our corporate accountant and tax advisor, Angela will also be your point of contact for help with billing and any questions you may have about getting data out of RubyWireless and into your accounting software.  She has a lifetime of experience in bookkeeping, accounting, and tax preparation too, so if you&rsquo;re a new agent needing those services, she&rsquo;s highly recommended.</p>

<p><img class="left card" src="https://ycpi-farm6.staticflickr.com/5515/12649894875_50aa89c26e_n.jpg" width="260" title="Photo of Jaytee" > Jaytee is the official/unofficial spokesperson for RubyWireless.  He&rsquo;s also the general manager of Sunshine Wireless, a succesful agent in the ENC market, so if you want the low down on our system from an Agent&rsquo;s prospective, he&rsquo;s the guy to talk to.  He&rsquo;s been involved in the development of RubyWireless since the beginning.  He also helps us out with training and while he doesn&rsquo;t advertise it, his sales experience is something you should definitely take advantage of when he&rsquo;s onsite.</p>

As a client, you&rsquo;ll likely talk with Melissa at some point.  A crucial member of the team, she answers the phones, sets up callbacks for accounting and technical help, and schedules demos.</p>

<p>She also often reminds the rest of us to stop and eat!</p>
